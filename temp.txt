In the home template

{% if user.is_authenticated %} no need of this as the below if will automatically handle this 
{% if user.username == blog.author %}  
    the data type of both the operands should be same if we want to compare the value 
    this code will always return false as 
        user.username is a charfield or string
        blog.author is not a string
            in the blog model , author field represents {another name of the foreign key } relationship to user , where user is a object from django builtin class 
            so string==object   --> gives false 

{% if user == blog.author or user == admin %} this is not the correct way 
{% if user == blog.author or user.is_superuser %} this is correct way 
also check what is the .is_staff
