only show the form if the user is logged in -->decorater
remove the author field and automatically bind the logged in user and the author in the forms page for the blog 
    -->use the user.username
        it shows the username at the place of the author field but it doesn't save the blog with the username in the backend bcZ the username is displayed through the get request ,its not going in the post request 
    --> add an additional field in the view before we validate the data 
    --> use auto add option in the model field itself like the date field 

while displaying the blog if the user is not logged in then show all the blogs with view option only if the user is logged in then show his blogs as view+update+delete and rest other users blog as view only .... if its admin login then full control 



The Blog could not be created because the data didn't validate.
to remove this removed the data.author field and added the user.username
